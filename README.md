## Phase 1 Project

## Project Overview

This project uses the Pandas library to analyze data on the movie industry, with a focus on determining whether or not Microsoft should enter the movie business.

### Business Understanding

Stakeholders: Microsoft, movie industry investors

Key Business Questions:

What is the current state of the movie industry in terms of revenue and profitability?
How has the industry been affected by the rise of streaming services?
What opportunities and challenges does the industry present for a new entrant like Microsoft?

### The Data

Movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

Description of data: The data includes information on movie budgets, gross revenue, release dates, and other details.


### Analysis

* **Industry valued at 95.45 billion in 2022, it's expected to jump to almost 170 billion in 2023.

The industry is growing!
Even after the pandemic, the industry is bouncing back stronger than ever thanks to streaming services.
Grew 13.5% from $27.29 B in 2022 to $30.99 B in 2023

Looking at the past ten years of movie data:
258 studios worldwide that were in the game
Only about 17% of them made 20/more movies during that time

There is opportunity for another power player!

Top Performing Studios:
Buena Vista (Disney)
Warner Bros
Universal Studios
Sony
Lion’s Gate

Based on a histogram of the total movies that these studios made and how successful they were, can see that Universal made the most movies over a 10 year period, almost 25% of the top of the market, but Buena Vista however was the most cost effective and brought in the strongest ROI, having made 60% of the most profitable movies during this period.
So the key isn’t how much you produce, but what you produce.
What are these money-making movies?

Most compromises of big blockbusters. 
We can break this down further into sequels and franchises.

Next is a bar graph of the top 20 most successful genres that came out of these top studios.
Most films fall under a combination of:
Adventure
Action
Drama
Sci-Fi
Fantasy
Comedy

But the most profitable were:
Adventure, 55% of the top 20
Action (35%)
Drama (35%)
Sci-Fi (30%)

Lastly, we have a scatter plotn showing the relationship between runtime and a movies success.
Most of these successful movies fell into a 92-118 minute range, however, Disney had a significant number of successful movies that were over 130 minutes (these came from franchises and sequels).

My Three Main Recommendations:
Focus on big blockbusters,  sequels, and franchises

Spend money to make money
Focus on the quality of content rather than quantity 
Disney's median spend = $131,261,111.11, so to mimic their success we should shoot for a similar budget.

Keep run time’s in 92-118 min range 
Bigger movies can get away with 130+
Limit to titles you feel will be most successful

NEXT STEPS!
Look at data after 2020
Same genres still successful?
Anything else we should dig into

Dig into successful content you already own that could easily be turned into a movie franchise
Games that potential has yet to be tapped?

Analyze deeper into best directors 

Should you consider streaming?? 


## Summary

In conclusion, the movie industry has remained a profitable sector despite the rise of streaming services. However, the industry presents a significant challenge for new entrants with high production and marketing costs. The data suggests that the most successful movies tend to have a high budget and gross revenue. Based on these findings, Microsoft should carefully consider the potential costs and revenue potential before entering the movie business and should definitely consider as well creating their own streaming platform.
